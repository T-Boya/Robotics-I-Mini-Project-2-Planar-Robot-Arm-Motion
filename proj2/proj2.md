# Robotics I
## Mini-Project 2: Planar Robot Arm Motion

## Running Instructions
The main matlab program robotics_proj2.m depends on robot.m and must be in the same directory, one within the MATLAB path. The code for each question is a different code section in robotics_proj2.m, each of which can be run individually and is self-contained. Each question should be run individually, then 'clear all' and 'close all' should be run. The only exception to this is Question 4 which requires the outputs of Question 1. In order ot achieve this, run Question 1 code then immediately run Question 4 code without clearing the workspace.
